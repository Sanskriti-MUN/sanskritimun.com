    <h2 class="comSubhead">Crisis Committee</h2>
    <p>
       The Cabinet of Col Gaddafi is one of the highest decision-making bodies for the state of Libya. The committee is convened to deliberate upon issues of national importance to formulate a long- term civil and military strategy. Alternatively, this committee is convened to address and adequately respond to immediate as well as impending crises. The Cabinet comprises generals, ministers as well as experts in specific fields including intelligence and communication and is thus capable of single headedly determining the actions taken by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. <br/><br/>I came to power by toppling the western backed imperialist regime that threatened the sovereignty, independence, and sanctity of our motherland. And ever since then I have brought peace, prosperity, and glory to my country. I made our country rise from the ashes of oppression and become one of the greatest nations in all of Africa. I headed cries of the people and tended to all their needs. I made health care and education free, made sure every Libyan had a roof over his head, and worked tirelessly for the betterment of my people. <br/><br/>And now, perhaps emboldened by my affection the ugly face of dissidence has reared its head. There are murmurs of spreading dissatisfaction and resentment among a populace that is increasingly unafraid of speaking out against imagined grievances. All this comes at a time when there is talk of a fractured military, one that is divided and undisciplined. There seems to be a newfound strength and courage of the desecrators who believe in the laughable ideas of liberalism and imperialism. <br/><br/>This ludicrous call for a “true’ democracy points toward the meddlesome interference of foreign powers who envy Libya’s growth and prosperity. They seek to deprive our people of the fruits of their persistence and wish only to satiate their greed by hoarding our resources. <br/><br/>We must fight these agents of chaos together, and to this end I call upon my most loyal generals and followers. We must crush those who oppose us, just as we did over forty years ago. We will stand together for we are the Jamahiriya, the state of the people, and stop this seed of dissent lest it lead to the downfall of the great nation we all built with our blood and sweat.<br/><br/>The fate of this nation and its people will be decided on the 21st of February 2011 when the committee is convoked. <br/><br/>Your brotherly leader<br/>Muammar al-Gaddafi <br/><br/> </p>
